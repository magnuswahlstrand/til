Today I learned that you can copy the output from the previous command in the terminal. 

```sh
> ls
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
Then use

* `Cmd + Shift + A` - Select previous command output
* `Cmd + C` - Copy

The following should be added to your clipboard:

`file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt`

Success!

**Note:** this doesn't always work, for some reason. Might be if you interact with the terminal in some other way.
