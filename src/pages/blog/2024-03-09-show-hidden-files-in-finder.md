Today I learned how to show hidden files in Finder on Mac. I've probably done this before, but not enough to remember it.

I'm currently working on a small to transfer translated words from my [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/kindle) to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). 
To do this I need to access the `vocab.db` file on my Kindle. The file is hidden, so I need to show hidden files in Finder.

I found the answer on [graphpad.com](https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/how-to-view-files-on-your-mac-that-are-normally-invisible/).

1. Open the folder in Finder
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + .` to show hidden files

That's it. 

_PS. If you need the vocabulary file from your Kindle, it is at `/System/vocabulary/vocab.db`._
