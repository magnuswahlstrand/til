Today I learned that you can search for and insert emojis in the Goland and on Mac. To summarize. **Cmd + Ctrl + Space** opens a nice window to search for emojis.

Normally, I use [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) to search for emojis. Today I figured that there might be able to do it from inside my editor. I use [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) (an Jetbrains IDE for Go). Using **Cmd + Shift + A**, I found the 
**"Emoji & Symbols" (Cmd + Ctrl + Space)** action, that let's us do just that.


Then I figured that Mac might have a similar feature, but they don't. In fact, the **Cmd + Ctrl + Space** command **IS** a Mac feature, not by Jetbrains.
