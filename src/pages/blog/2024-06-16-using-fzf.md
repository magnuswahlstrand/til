Today I learned how to use the terminal command Â´fzf`. I've seen seen it used in the past, but haven't gotten around to
using it myself. Initially inspired by [this Youtube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wYHhCg9jDIo), then got some
more tips and tricks from [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgG5Jhi_Els).

Let's go!

## 1. Preview file output, during `fzf` file search:

```shell
fzf --preview 'cat {}'
``` 

## 2. Exact matching

Fuzzy search is very useful, but sometimes it is useful to only get exact matchers. We can do that with the `-e/--exact`
flag.

```shell
fzf -e
```

## 3. Trigger fuzzy completion

We can trigger `fzf` in the terminal, by doing `cd **<TAB>` to trigger a fzf search for the directory. Other usages

* `kill -9 **<TAB>` - search processes to kill
* `export **<TAB>` - search environment variables to export

More ideas on [Github](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#fuzzy-completion-for-bash-and-zsh).

## 4. Hotkey

By setting up the shell integration (I use zsh), we can also get key bindings.

* `CTRL + T` - search for files
* `ALT + C` - search for directories
* `CTRL + R` - search for history

That's all!
