Today I learned that you can use `Fn + Left Arrow` and `Fn + Right Arrow` as Home and End keys on macOS.

I discovered this while trying to find a way to quickly navigate to the latest message in [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai).

## Key combinations

- `Fn + Left Arrow` - Jump to beginning of document/page (Home)
- `Fn + Right Arrow` - Jump to end of document/page (End)

This works in most text editors, browsers, and applications on macOS.

## Related shortcuts

- `Fn + Up Arrow` - Page Up
- `Fn + Down Arrow` - Page Down

No more endless scrolling!
