Today I followed along to [this Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZuk6Wkx_Eg), and learned some things about using Figma. 
* **F** lets us to create a **f**rame.  
* Add layout columns by clicking **layout grid**, and change from **grid** to **columns**
* **R** lets us to create a **r**rectangle.
* Move the viewport by pressing space
* Duplicate object by pressing **option** and dragging an object
