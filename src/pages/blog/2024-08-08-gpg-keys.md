Today I was using [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) for the first time, and had to generate a GPG key for it. I haven't done that in a while, so here are a few things I (re)learned:


## Generate a new key

```sh
gpg --full-generate-key
```

This will prompt you for a few things like key type, key size and expiration, name and email. They defaults are probably fine, though it has no expiration.

## Listing keys

Now we can list the public keys we have:

```sh
gpg --list-keys
...
[keyboxd]
---------
pub   ed25519 2024-08-08 [SC]
      95F7AF2369007FAE8D7999DC03E2C00D88AB68F0
uid           [ultimate] Magnus Wahlstrand <magnus.wahlstrand@gmail.com>
sub   cv25519 2024-08-08 [E]
```

Or private keys:

```sh
gpg --list-secret-keys
...
[keyboxd]
---------
sec   ed25519 2024-08-08 [SC]
      95F7AF2369007FAE8D7999DC03E2C00D88AB68F0
uid           [ultimate] Magnus Wahlstrand <magnus.wahlstrand@gmail.com>
ssb   cv25519 2024-08-08 [E]
```

In my case they have the same ID, since they were generated together.

## Exporting the key
Then we can export the public key, for example to share with someone else:

```sh
gpg --armor --export <key-id>
...
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

=QoIf
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

This turns the binary keys into ASCII, which is easier to share. See also til: [ASCII and .asc](./2024-08-08-ascii-and-asc).

## Uploading the key to Github

We can upload the public key to Github, for example, to use with git-crypt by going to [github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys). Finally, you can share the uploaded key by going to **github.com/<your-username>.gpg**, e.g. [github.com/magnuswahlstrand.gpg](https://github.com/magnuswahlstrand.gpg).

Et voil√†!
